# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

This is a weather app that allows you to get the current weather information for a specific location. It utilizes asynchronous programming and API calls to fetch the weather data from Weather API. The app is built using webpack to bundle and optimize the JavaScript code.

My goal behind the building of this app was to practice working with asynchronous JavaScript, making API calls, and handling the response data. Some of the the new plugins and loaders that I used in this project are: prettier, eslint, babel and fontawesome.
